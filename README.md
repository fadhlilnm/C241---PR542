## DESCRIPTION
The Machine Learning model can be used to make recommendation of warkop around the jabodetabek area.

## METHOD
Recommender System (tfrs)

## TOOLS
- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Google Collab
- Jupyter Notebook
- Visual Studio Code
- requests
- BeautifulSoup
- lxml

## DATASETS 

We get the dataset from scraping google maps api. 

- Dataset

## HOW TO PREDICT
The Machine Learning model can recommend the best warkop based on these features :
- Parking
- 24 hour availability
- rating
- Ac
- Toilet
- wifi
	

## DEPLOYMENT 
We use TensorFlow Lite to deploy a trained Machine Learning model on Android.
